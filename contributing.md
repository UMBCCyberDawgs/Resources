We would love for you to contribute to this collection of resources. In order
to keep this organized and maintainable we ask that you follow these guidelines
below. 

## Getting started 

The first thing you will need to contribute is a git client. On Linux all you
need to do is use your distro's package manager to install the git package. On
Windows or OSx you will need to go to the [git download page][1] and get either
the command line package or a GUI client.

First you will need to <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip"
data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.git_fork}}">fork</a> the project.
To fork the project first login to (or create) your GitHub account. Once you're
logged you can [fork][2] the repository. Now you can clone your copy of the
repository and make your changes. Once you are done submit a <a href="#"
data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.git_pull_request}}">
pull request</a>.
