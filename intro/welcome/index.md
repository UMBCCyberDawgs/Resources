## Welcome!

*Note: this guide isn't ready yet... But we're working on it*

So if you know absolutely nothing about computer security, you've come to the
right place.

It's our goal for anyone that *wants* to learn about security to be
able to. We've written this sequence of guides to start with the very basic
stuff, and work you up to where you would be able to help us in a competition.
(Or, if you don't want to do competition, where your skills would be useful in
the real world.)

It will take some work, but if you're willing to work at it,
many of our club members are willing to help you where you get stuck.

Welcome to the club, and good luck!

## How to start

Just start with the first guide on the left under **Intro to Security**.
