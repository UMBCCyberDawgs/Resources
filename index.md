## Overview 

These brief instructions will help you get started quickly with the theme. The other topics in this help provide additional information and detail about working with other aspects of this theme and Jekyll.

## Build this theme

If you're used to running Jekyll sites, you can type the normal jekyll command, `jekyll serve`, to run this site. However, if you're a new Jekyll user or if you run into issues, see the following two topics:

* {{site.data.urls.mydoc_install_jekyll_on_mac.link}}
* {{site.data.urls.mydoc_install_jekyll_on_windows.link}}

## Managing links

If you want to use a simple system for managing links, see the "Managed Links" section in {{site.data.urls.mydoc_hyperlinks.link}}.

## Other instructions

For other details in working with the theme, see the various sections in the sidebar.
